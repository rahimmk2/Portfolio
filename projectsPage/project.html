      </p>
      <p class="description">
        Constructed a Chrome extension that seamlessly integrates with the NER model to identify and emphasize all entities present on a webpage, allowing for swift and accurate recognition of entities in real-time.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        Incorporated user-friendly features such as entity type filtering and customizable highlighting, augmenting the user's text analysis capabilities while simultaneously elevating their overall experience with the tool.

      <h3>SUI 2 SWE</h3>
      <p class="tags">Sui Blockchain, C++(Data-Structures)</p>
      <p class="description">
        Worked on implementing a user friendly way to visualize the SUI blockchain data by pulling data from the blockchain in the form of DAG.

      </p>

      <p class="description">
        Running a full node, provided the entire dataset, containing transactions,checkpoints 
        and epoch changes. The data was stored in a relational database maintaining its DAG relations.
      </p>

      <p class="description">
        Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm finds the minimum gas value between two given transactions to determine the least expensive way to reach a node from the starting node.
Implemented topological sort to psuedo-visualize the blockchain dataset after performing DFS and Dijkstra's on the dataset.

      <h3>Abalone Gender-Classification</h3>
      <p class="tags">Python, Scikit-Learn</p>
      <p class="description">
      Developed and implemented supervised learning models, including logistic regression and KNN classification, as well as linear regression, ridge regression, and lasso regression algorithms, to analyze and make predictions and classification on the dataset
      </p>
      <p class="description">
      Utilized hyperparameter tuning techniques and ensemble learning methods such as bootstrap aggregation, adaptive boosting, and gradient boosting to optimize model performance, resulting in increased accuracy

      <h3>UI-Eats</h3>
      <p class="tags">Flutter, Dart, Android Home Studio, X-Code</p>
      <p class="description">
         Designed and developed an app with dart and flutter that presented all the restaurant options available on campus, categorized
         by their cuisines. App developed and implemented on both android based and IOS based emulators. Furthermore, integrated a time function in the app to indicate
        which restaurants are currently
        open and which are closed. 
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        In backend, the app was linked to a self-created CSV file that contained the data of all the restaurants
        present on campus. Furthermore, each restaurant has its own page/screen which display a short bio of it,
        its cuisine and its location on campus. 
      </p>

      <p class="description">
        The multi-page front-end was implemented using routes on a total of two pages as the second page
        displayed the bio of the restaurant,the page description and the title which was directly read from the CSV file, thus making
        the program efficient.

      <h3>New York Taxi Trips</h3>
      <p class="tags">C++(Data-Structures)</p>
      <p class="description">
        The dataset containing the information about the New York yellow cabs
        was used to develop a program that could read the file and implement multiple 
        algorithms to perform the relevant traversals to answer multiple queries.
      </p>

      <p class="description">
        The data was read from a csv file and stored using the data structures of linked
        list and binary search trees. The implementation of trees allowed an efficent run-time
        of O log-n to perform searches on the data. 
        Implementing trees allowed to reduce the
        run-time for searching of the data.
        entered by the user.
      </p>
      <p class="description">
        The program implemented functions and DFS to search the top 10 cheapest trips in NYC, 
        the most visited locations, and utilized the data to calculate an estimated fare between two locations.

      <h3>Color Coding Bees</h3>
      <p class="tags">3D-Laser Cutting, LDR Circuits</p>
      <p class="lastdescription">
        As the process of color-coding bees has always been manual,I worked in a research group on a project that could automate the process of color-coding 
        bees. LDR were integrated in the circuit which coupled with tubes constructed by 3D laser-cutting allowed 
        the bees to enter the hive. The tube had  holes which allowed the dot-matrix printer to code the bees
        while they enter the hive.
