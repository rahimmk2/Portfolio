      <p class="description">
        Participated in multiple workshops held on campus by Sig-Mobile and completed weekly assignments
        to understand the in-depth working of flutter and dart. The workshops educated us on the essential tools to master 
        to start making apps in flutter. Midway during the semester, groups were formed where 
        we developed a fully functional multi-page app on android and IOS emulators backed by a csv file.

      <p class="description">
        Worked in a research project held by the RSO WaggleNet.We were tasked
        to automate the process of color-coding bees as up to date it has always been done
        manually. The color-coding indicates the which hive does the bee belong to. We developed
         a prototype using a dot-matrix printer, a plastic tube formed  
         by 3-D laser cutting technology and a circuit built with several light-dependent resistors.
